This is the code repository for [Python Feature Engineering Cookbook-Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/python-feature-engineering-cookbook-second-edition/9781804611302), published by Packt.

**Over 70 recipes for creating, engineering, and transforming features to build machine learning models**

## What is this book about?
Feature engineering, the process of transforming variables and creating features, albeit time-consuming, ensures that your machine learning models perform seamlessly. This second edition of Python Feature Engineering Cookbook will take the struggle out of feature engineering by showing you how to use open source Python libraries to accelerate the process via a plethora of practical, hands-on recipes.

This updated edition begins by addressing fundamental data challenges such as missing data and categorical values, before moving on to strategies for dealing with skewed distributions and outliers. The concluding chapters show you how to develop new features from various types of data, including text, time series, and relational databases. With the help of numerous open source Python libraries, you'll learn how to implement each feature engineering method in a performant, reproducible, and elegant manner.

By the end of this Python book, you will have the tools and expertise needed to confidently build end-to-end and reproducible feature engineering pipelines that can be deployed into production.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Impute missing data using various univariate and multivariate methods
* Encode categorical variables with one-hot, ordinal, and count encoding
* Handle highly cardinal categorical variables
* Transform, discretize, and scale your variables
* Create variables from date and time with pandas and Feature-engine
* Combine variables into new features
* Extract features from text as well as from transactional data with Featuretools
* Create features from time series data with tsfresh

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
X_train = pd.DataFrame(
    X_train,
    columns=numeric_vars + remaining_vars,
)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for machine learning and data science students and professionals, as well as software engineers working on machine learning model deployment, who want to learn more about how to transform their data and create new features to train machine learning models in a better way.	

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
